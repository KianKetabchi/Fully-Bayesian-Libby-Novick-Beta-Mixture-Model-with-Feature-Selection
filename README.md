# Fully-Bayesian-Libby-Novick-Beta-Mixture-Model-with-Feature-Selection
In this Study, we applied our model to a publicly
available dataset of blood cell images (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/blood-cells). This dataset
consists of a total of 12500 images of blood cells. There
are approximately 3,000 images for each of 4 different cell
types.
